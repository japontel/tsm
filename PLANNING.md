  - Network configuration
- [ ] Write initial README.md with setup instructions (2 hours)

### 2. Backend Development (4 days)
#### Database Setup
- [ ] Design and create database schema (2 hours)
- [ ] Set up migrations (2 hours)

#### API Development
- [ ] Implement transaction creation endpoint (1 day)
  - Input validation
  - Trace number generation system
  - Error handling
- [ ] Implement transaction listing endpoint with filters (1 day)
  - Pagination

## Dependencies and Resources Needed

### Development Tools
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PHP 8.x
- MySQL 8.x
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### Backend Framework Options
- Laravel (recommended for built-in features)
- Symfony (alternative option)

### Frontend Libraries
- React
- Axios for API calls
- React Query for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Testing Tools
- PHPUnit for backend testing
- Jest for frontend testing
- Postman for API testing

## Total Estimated Time: 15 days

## Risk Factors and Mitigation Strategies
1. **Data Volume Handling**
   - Risk: Performance issues with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination, indexing, and batch processing

2. **Docker Configuration**
   - Risk: Integration issues between containers
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing of inter-container communication

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - Risk: Slow response times with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, optimize queries, use appropriate indexes

## Next Steps
1. Set up repository and provide access
2. Create initial Docker configuration
3. Begin backend development
4. Document progress daily
