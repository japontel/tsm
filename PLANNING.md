# Transaction Management System - Project Planning

## Project Overview
Development of a full-stack Transaction Management System using PHP backend, React frontend, and Docker containerization.

## Task Breakdown & Time Estimates

### 1. Initial Setup and Configuration (4 hours)
- [ ] Create GitHub repository and provide access to dsalazar@blossom.net
- [ ] Create basic project structure
- [ ] Set up Docker environment
  - Docker configuration for PHP/MySQL/Nginx
  - Container separation for backend, frontend, and database
  - Network configuration
- [ ] Write initial README.md with setup instructions

### 2. Backend Development (1 hours)
#### Database Setup
- [ ] Design and create database schema
- [ ] Set up migrations

#### API Development (2 hours)
- [ ] Implement transaction creation endpoint
  - Input validation
  - Trace number generation system
  - Error handling
- [ ] Implement transaction listing endpoint with filters
  - Pagination
  - Date range filtering
  - Transaction type filtering
- [ ] Implement transaction deletion endpoint
- [ ] Write API documentation

### 3. Frontend Development (3 hours)
- [ ] Set up React project structure 
- [ ] Create dashboard component
  - Transaction list view
  - Sorting functionality
  - Filtering controls
- [ ] Implement transaction creation form
- [ ] Add delete transaction functionality
- [ ] Style components and ensure responsiveness

### 4. Performance Optimization (4 hours)
- [ ] Develop CSV import script
- [ ] Implement batch processing for large datasets
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Document findings in PERFORMANCE.md

### 5. Testing and Documentation (2 hours)
- [ ] Write unit tests for backend (1 day)
- [ ] Complete CODE_REVIEW.md for txnExportService.php (4 hours)

## Dependencies and Resources Needed

### Development Tools
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PHP 8.x
- MySQL 8.x
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### Backend Framework Options
- Laravel (recommended for built-in features)
- Symfony (alternative option)

### Frontend Libraries
- React
- Axios for API calls
- React Query for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Testing Tools
- PHPUnit for backend testing
- Jest for frontend testing
- Postman for API testing

## Total Estimated Time: 16 Hours

## Risk Factors and Mitigation Strategies
1. **Data Volume Handling**
   - Risk: Performance issues with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination, indexing, and batch processing

2. **Docker Configuration**
   - Risk: Integration issues between containers
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing of inter-container communication

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - Risk: Slow response times with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, optimize queries, use appropriate indexes

## Next Steps
1. Set up repository and provide access
2. Create initial Docker configuration
3. Begin backend development
4. Document progress daily
