# Performance Analysis - Transaction Management System

## Import Process Analysis

### Test Environment
- Docker containers running on local machine
- Database: MySQL 8.0
- PHP 8.2
- 500,000 records imported
- CSV file size: ~150MB
- Hardware: [Tu especificaci√≥n de hardware]

### Import Statistics
- Total records processed: 500,000
- Total import time: ~1 minute
- Average import rate: ~8,333 records per second
- Peak memory usage: [Podemos obtener esto del siguiente script]

### Optimization Techniques Implemented

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Records are processed in batches of 1000 to optimize memory usage
   - Each batch is inserted in a single transaction to improve database performance
   - Memory is freed after each batch using garbage collection

2. **Database Optimizations**
   - Indexes are created after data import to improve import speed
   - Foreign key checks are disabled during import
   - Bulk insert statements are used instead of individual inserts


### Current Limitations

1. **Memory Usage**
   - Large CSV files must be processed in chunks to avoid memory exhaustion
   - Each batch of 1000 records consumes approximately X MB of memory

2. **Database Constraints**
   - MySQL's `max_allowed_packet` setting may limit batch size
   - Temporary table space may become a bottleneck
   - Write speed is limited by disk I/O

3. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Process is single-threaded
   - Limited by available database connections
   - Network bandwidth between application and database can become a bottleneck

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Short Term Optimizations**
   - Implement parallel processing for batch imports
   - Add progress tracking and resumable imports
   - Optimize memory usage with generators
   - Add error handling for failed records

2. **Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Consider using database partitioning for large datasets
   - Implement queue system for async processing
   - Add monitoring for memory and CPU usage
